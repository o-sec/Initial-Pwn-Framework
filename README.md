# Initial-Pwn-Framework

**Initial-Pwn-Framework** is a offensive-security framework that focuses entirely on **client-side attack vectors** used to gain initial access in real-world environments. It brings together a wide range of techniques commonly employed in red teaming, phishing campaigns, malware delivery.

This framework is designed to serve as a **go-to reference and toolkit** for penetration testers, red teamers, during pre-exploitation stages, where **user interaction or endpoint vulnerabilities** are leveraged to compromise systems.
